# Object-Detection-and-Classification-using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can accurately detect and classify objects in images. The model will use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically learn features from the input images and identify the objects present in them.
